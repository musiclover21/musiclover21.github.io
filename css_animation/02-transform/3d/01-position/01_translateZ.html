/*                same as postion or view points, "It looks good from my position, it looks good from my viewpoint, it looks good from my perspective*/

/*                What really matters is perspective() function which positions the viewer relative to the plane that lies where z=0 (the surface of the screen). A value of 500px means the user is 500 pixels "in front of" the imagery located at z=0.*/

/*                Then, the translateZ() function moves the element 200 pixels "outward" from the screen, toward the user. This has the effect of making the element appear larger when viewed on a 2D display, or closer when viewed using a VR headset or other 3D display device.*/
